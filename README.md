# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using two main approaches:

- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the similarity between movie attributes (e.g., genres, descriptions).

- Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies by finding patterns from user ratings (using matrix factorization or neighborhood-based approaches).

The goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie characteristics.
